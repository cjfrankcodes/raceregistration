# raceregistration
My very first HTML Project
<div>
This project is very simple but it is something I am very proud of. This is my very first project ever coded on my own without watching a step by step video. This project is coded using strictly HTML. This project is a simple race registration form that was a suggestion given to me during Colt Steele's Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. This file includes 5 forms that can be submitted to a second file. All forms are labeled for accesibility. Each of the name forms, email and password forms are also required to submit, as well as the password having a minimum and maximum legnth required to submit the form. I learned this information over the course of 3 days during my Udemy bootcamp and this is a site that I hope to look back on years down the line and smile at.
